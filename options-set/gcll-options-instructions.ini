<p>Please also see the README file distributed with this plugin and the plugin's main page: <a href="http://gregsplugins.com/lib/plugin-details/gregs-comment-length-limiter/">Greg's Comment Length Limiter plugin</a>.</p>

<p>For details on how to wrap the following template tags (<em>aka</em> 'functions') in conditionals so your theme will only rely on this plugin when it is activated, please see the <a href="http://gregsplugins.com/lib/faq/">Greg's Plugins FAQ</a>.</p>

<h4>WordPress 3.0+ With New Comment Form Function</h4>

<p>Under WordPress 3.0 and later, the entire comment form can be generated via a single call to the function <code>comment_form()</code>. If your theme uses the new <code>comment_form</code>, this plugin can automatically tweak the form so comments can be counted. The plugin filters the <code>comment_field</code> default and inserts the countdown box just after the <code>label</code> tag for the comment area.</p>

<h4>WordPress 3.0+ Customized Limit Box Insertion -- Only if You Really Feel the Need</h4>

<p>If you'd really really really rather position the countdown box yourself, you can do so by tapping into the standard comment form filters and inserting the value returned by <code>gcll_show_limit_box_for_filtering()</code>. The function takes an optional parameter, which is the name of the class for the <code>span</code> which will wrap the box.</p>

<p>When using comment form filters to insert the limit box, also be sure to include the value returned by <code>gcll_tweak_textarea_for_filtering</code> within the textarea tag of your comment form -- thereby replicating the end result of following the pre-3.0 instructions below.</p>

<p>If your theme does not use the new 3.0 functionality, <em>or if you would rather not have to tweak two separate comment form filters</em>, please use the instructions in the following section.</p>

<p>[Brief Editorial Rant. The new <code>comment_form</code> is great for very minor modifications of what the WordPress coders think a comment form ought to look like, but if you want more than a couple of very minor changes, it can be even more tedious to work with than the old spaghetti mix of code and markup... Maybe one day WordPress will adopt the magic of templating, in which one specifies how something should be <em>structured</em>, and separate code fills in elements of that structure -- rather than adding layers upon layers of <em>more code</em> (i.e., filters) to modify structure and thereby deal with weaknesses of the design decision to mix code with markup in the first place.]</p>

<h4>Wordpress 2.9.2 and Earlier, And 3.0+ Themes Without the New Comment Form Functionality</h4>

<p>Preparing your comment form for length limiting is still very straightforward:</p>

<ol class="gcll_numlist">
	<li>Add the following template tag inside the textarea tag of your comment area, preferably wrapped in a conditional that tests whether the function exists: <code>gcll_tweak_textarea()</code></li>
	<li>Optionally, if you would like to position the countdown box yourself, add the following template tag wherever you would like the box to appear within your comment form, again preferably wrapped in a conditional that tests whether the function exists: <code>gcll_show_limit_box_manually()</code></li>
</ol>

<h3>Sustainable Plugin Development -- and Your Privacy</h3>

<p>Obviously, this software is provided for free. Equally obviously, it was not built for free. And hopefully also equally obviously, the software offers significant value to blog owners by adding new features to comments.</p>

<p>Many end users of plugins -- folks like yourself -- do send along a monetary contribution to authors of plugins they particularly like or benefit from. Truth be told, though, they're very much in the minority. For many other blog owners, the eyes just kind of glaze over when they see those 'donate' buttons. Install it, configure it, forget about it -- out of sight, out of mind, right? If WordPress itself is free, then everything should be free, shouldn't it? (Hey, my baby was free! What do you mean I ought to pay for her shoes?! Are you some kind of child-profiteer or something?) Right...</p>

<p>Repeatedly investing to provide innovative software that only a small minority of folks decide to contribute to (or even say 'thank you' for) just isn't a sustainable way to live. That's one main reason why so many otherwise good plugins wind up getting abandoned by their disillusioned authors, repeatedly leaving users with the hassle of searching out new ways to get the job done. Few developers actually aim to profit from writing plugins -- most of the reward comes from providing some value to the world -- but remember that when a developer is writing a plugin, they are almost always taking time away from their paid jobs, time away from their families, and time away from other personal interests.</p>

<p>As a participant in the <a href="http://pluginsponsors.com">Sustainable Plugins Sponsorship Network</a> (SPSN), I'm trying to offset some of the large investment which goes into the creation and maintenance of plugins. The SPSN model offers modest sponsorships to plugin authors in return for a small amount of screen real estate on plugin options pages. This helps out a little for the majority of cases where blog owners don't feel they receive enough benefit from a plugin to say thank you with a financial contribution. If you're one of those blog owners who <em>does</em> receive enough benefit from this plugin that you'll be willing to contribute to it, however, you can easily switch off the SPSN sponsor messages altogether: just visit the <em>Contribute</em> section.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT PRIVACY INFORMATION:</strong> NO INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE DETAILS OF ANY KIND, REGARDING EITHER YOU OR YOUR SITE, will be collected or shared as a result of displaying Sustainable Plugins Sponsorship Network (SPSN) sponsor messages. Sponsors receive only aggregate reports of impressions on a worldwide per-plugin basis, NOT on impressions or on any other activity at any individual site which happens to be using a plugin.</p>
