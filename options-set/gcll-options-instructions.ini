<h3>Limiting the Length of Comments</h3>

<div class="gtcn_aside">
<h4>Updates on Greg's WordPress Plugins</h4>
<p>You can keep up on the latest plugin announcements and tutorials by visiting <a href="http://counsellingresource.com/features/tag/wordpress-plugins/">Greg's WordPress Plugins</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Please also see the README file distributed with this plugin and the original plugin announcement page at: <a href="http://counsellingresource.com/features/2009/02/04/comment-length-limiter-plugin/">Greg's Comment Length Limiter plugin</a>.</p>

<p>For details on how to wrap the following template tags (<em>aka</em> 'functions') in conditionals so your theme will only rely on this plugin when it is activated, please see the announcement page for one of my other plugins at: <a href="http://counsellingresource.com/features/2009/01/27/threaded-comment-numbering-plugin-for-wordpress/">Greg's Threaded Comment Numbering plugin</a>.</p>

<p>Preparing your comment form for length limiting is very straightforward:</p>

<ol class="gcll_numlist">
	<li>Make sure your comment form has a <code>name</code> attribute of <code>commentform</code></li>
	<li>Add the following template tag inside the textarea tag of your comment area, preferably wrapped in a conditional that tests whether the function exists: <code>gcll_tweak_textarea()</code></li>
	<li>Optionally, if you would like to position the countdown box yourself, add the following template tag wherever you would like the box to appear within your comment form, again preferably wrapped in a conditional that tests whether the function exists: <code>gcll_show_limit_box_manually()</code></li>
</ol>

<h3>Sustainable Plugin Development -- and Your Privacy</h3>

<p>Obviously, this software is provided for free. Equally obviously, it was not built for free. And hopefully also equally obviously, the software offers significant value to blog owners by adding new features to comments.</p>

<p>Many end users of plugins -- folks like yourself -- do send along a monetary contribution to authors of plugins they particularly like or benefit from. Truth be told, though, they're very much in the minority. For many other blog owners, the eyes just kind of glaze over when they see those 'donate' buttons. Install it, configure it, forget about it -- out of sight, out of mind, right? If WordPress itself is free, then everything should be free, shouldn't it? (Hey, my baby was free! What do you mean I ought to pay for her shoes?! Are you some kind of child-profiteer or something?) Right...</p>

<p>Repeatedly investing to provide innovative software that only a small minority of folks decide to contribute to (or even say 'thank you' for) just isn't a sustainable way to live. That's one main reason why so many otherwise good plugins wind up getting abandoned by their disillusioned authors, repeatedly leaving users with the hassle of searching out new ways to get the job done. Few developers actually aim to profit from writing plugins -- most of the reward comes from providing some value to the world -- but remember that when a developer is writing a plugin, they are almost always taking time away from their paid jobs, time away from their families, and time away from other personal interests.</p>

<p>As a participant in the <a href="http://pluginsponsors.com">Sustainable Plugins Sponsorship Network</a> (SPSN), I'm trying to offset some of the large investment which goes into the creation and maintenance of plugins. The SPSN model offers modest sponsorships to plugin authors in return for a small amount of screen real estate on plugin options pages. This helps out a little for the majority of cases where blog owners don't feel they receive enough benefit from a plugin to say thank you with a financial contribution. If you're one of those blog owners who <em>does</em> receive enough benefit from this plugin that you'll be willing to contribute to it, however, you can easily switch off the SPSN sponsor messages altogether: just visit the <em>Contribute</em> section.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT PRIVACY INFORMATION:</strong> NO INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE DETAILS OF ANY KIND, REGARDING EITHER YOU OR YOUR SITE, will be collected or shared as a result of displaying Sustainable Plugins Sponsorship Network (SPSN) sponsor messages. Sponsors receive only aggregate reports of impressions on a worldwide per-plugin basis, NOT on impressions or on any other activity at any individual site which happens to be using a plugin.</p>
