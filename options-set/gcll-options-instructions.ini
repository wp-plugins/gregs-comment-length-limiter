<h4>Updates on Greg's WordPress Plugins</h4>
<p>You can keep up on the latest plugin announcements and tutorials by visiting <a href="http://counsellingresource.com/features/tag/wordpress-plugins/">Greg's WordPress Plugins</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Please also see the README file distributed with this plugin and the original plugin announcement page at: <a href="http://counsellingresource.com/features/2009/02/04/comment-length-limiter-plugin/">Greg's Comment Length Limiter plugin</a>.</p>

<p>For details on how to wrap the following functions in conditionals so your theme will only rely on this plugin when it is activated, please see the announcement page for one of my other plugins at: <a href="http://counsellingresource.com/features/2009/01/27/threaded-comment-numbering-plugin-for-wordpress/">Greg's Threaded Comment Numbering plugin</a>.</p>

<p>Preparing your comment form for length limiting is very straightforward:</p>

<ol class="gcll_numlist">
	<li>Make sure your comment form has a <code>name</code> attribute of <code>commentform</code></li>
	<li>Add the following function call inside the textarea tag of your comment area, preferably wrapped in a conditional that tests whether the function exists: <code>gcll_tweak_textarea()</code></li>
	<li>Optionally, if you would like to position the countdown box yourself, add the following function call wherever you would like the box to appear within your comment form, again preferably wrapped in a conditional that tests whether the function exists: <code>gcll_show_limit_box_manually()</code></li>
</ol>
